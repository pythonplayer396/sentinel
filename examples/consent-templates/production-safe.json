 This consent template is intended for production scans that are more
# passive and have minimal impact on the target application. It is
# suitable for high-profile targets where the security team wishes to
# minimize the impact of the scan.
#
# The security team should review the scope and notes of this template
# to ensure it aligns with their organization's security policy.
